      Hi, ${profile.name}
      <br/>
      Welcome to the admin pages of my CV.
      <br/>
      I'll let you in here for a look around, but you won't be able to save any changes unless you're me.
      <span if.bind="profile.user_id !== 'github|3257273'">(Which you aren't)</span>
      <br/>
      I'm using Auth0 to do Auth, and AWS Cognito to provide anonymous profile tracking and access to my backend services.
      <br/>
      It all seems to work pretty well.
      <br/>
      I see you've signed in with ${profile.identities[0].provider}.
      <br/>
      Why don't you
      <span if.bind="profile.identities[0].provider === 'github'">
        <a href="https://github.com/mtranter">follow me?</a>
      </span>
      <span if.bind="profile.identities[0].provider === 'linkedin'">
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markatranter/">connect with me?</a>
      </span>
